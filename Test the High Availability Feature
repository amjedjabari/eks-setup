Test the High Availability Features of Your EKS Cluster

    In the AWS console, on the EC2 instances page, select the three t3.micro instances.

    Click Actions > Instance State > Stop.

    In the dialog, click Yes, Stop.

    After a few minutes, we should see EKS launching new instances to keep our service running.

    In the CLI, check the status of our nodes:

    # kubectl get node

    All the nodes should be down (i.e., display a NotReady status).

    Check the pods using `watch -n` option:

   # watch -n 1 kubectl get pod

    We'll see a few different statuses — Terminating, Running, and Pending — because, as the instances shut down, EKS is trying to restart the pods.
    use CTRL + C to break out of watch command output.

    Check the nodes again:

   # kubectl get node

    We should see a new node, which we can identify by its age.

    Wait a few minutes, and then check the nodes again:

    # kubectl get node

    We should have one in a Ready state.

    Check the pods again:

    # kubectl get pod

    We should see a couple pods are now running as well.

    Check the service status:

    # kubectl get service

    Copy the external DNS Hostname listed in the output.

    Access the application using the load balancer, replacing <LOAD_BALANCER_DNS_HOSTNAME> with the DNS Hostname you just copied:

    # curl "<LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP>"

    We should see the Nginx web page HTML again. (If you don't, wait a few more minutes.)

    In a new browser tab, navigate to the same IP, where we should again see the Nginx web page.

    Summary, high availability is one of the greate features of AWS EKS!
    
    Thank you,
