    Create a Deployment on Your EKS Cluster.

    Install Git:

    # sudo yum install -y git

    Download the course files:

    # git clone https://github.com/amjedjabari/eks-setup.git

    Change directory:

    # cd eks-setup

    Take a look at the deployment file:

    # cat nginx-deployment.yaml

    Take a look at the service file:

    # cat nginx-svc.yaml

    Create the service:

    # kubectl apply -f ./nginx-svc.yaml

    Check its status:

    # kubectl get svc
    
    Copy the external DNS hostname of the load balancer, and paste it into a text file, as we'll need it in a minute.

    Create the deployment:

    # kubectl apply -f ./nginx-deployment.yaml

    Check its status:

    # kubectl get deployment

    View the pods:

    # kubectl get pod

    View the ReplicaSets:

    # kubectl get rs

    View the nodes:

    # kubectl get node

    Access the application using the load balancer, replacing <LOAD_BALANCER_DNS_HOSTNAME> with the IP you copied earlier:

    # curl "<LOAD_BALANCER_DNS_HOSTNAME>"

    The output should be the HTML for a default Nginx web page.

    In a new browser tab, navigate to the same IP, where we should then see the same Nginx web page.
